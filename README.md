# UiPathAutomationACMEWebForm
This UiPath project uses nested "Use Application/Browser" activities to first log into the ACME Webpage, navigate to the employees tab, retrieve the details of the first employee in the list from the pop-up, then navigate to a webform where it enters and submits said employee details. The UI then returns to to the ACME page and refreshes it.
